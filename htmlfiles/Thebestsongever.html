        If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
        <br>
        I'd been married long time ago
        <br>
        Where did you come from, where did you go?
        <br>
        Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
        <br>
        <br>
        If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
        <br>
        I'd been married long time ago
        <br>
        Where did you come from, where did you go?
        <br>
        Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
        <br>
        <br>
        If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
        <br>
        I'd been married long time ago
        <br>
        Where did you come from, where did you go?
        <br>
        Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
        <br>
        <br>
        If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
        <br>
        I'd been married long time ago
        <br>
        Where did you come from, where did you go?
        <br>
        Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
        <br>
        <br>
        He came to town like a midwinter storm
        <br>
        He rode through the fields, so handsome and strong
        <br>
        His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun
        <br>
        But all he had come for was having some fun
        <br>
        <br>
        If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
        <br>
        I'd been married long time ago
        <br>
        Where did you come from, where did you go?
        <br>
        Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
        <br>
        <br>
        If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
        <br>
        I'd been married long time ago
        <br>
        Where did you come from, where did you go?
        <br>
        Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
        <br>
        <br>
        He brought disaster wherever he went
        <br>
        The hearts of the girls was to Hell, broken, sent
        <br>
        They all ran away so nobody would know
        <br>
        And left only men 'cause of Cotton-Eye Joe
        <br>
        <br>
        If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
        <br>
        I'd been married long time ago
        <br>
        Where did you come from, where did you go?
        <br>
        Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
        <br>
        <br>
        If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
        <br>
        I'd been married long time ago
        <br>
        Where did you come from, where did you go?
        <br>
        Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
        <br>
        <br>
        If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
        <br>
        I'd been married long time ago
        <br>
        Where did you come from, where did you go?
        <br>
        Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
        <br>
        <br>
        If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
        <br>
        I'd been married long time ago
